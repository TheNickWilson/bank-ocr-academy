# BankOCR Demo for the Academy

This is an example solution to the [BankOCR kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/)
as a demonstration for the HMRC DDCN Academy 2018.  It omits the file reading / writing
aspect in order to focus on the core logic.

To see how the solution evolved, I added tags `step1` to `step8` to track key points in the solution's development.
To follow along, use:

``` bash
git checkout step1
git log      # The commit message briefly explains what was added in this step

# Take a look at the tests and code

git checkout step2
git log

# etc.
```
